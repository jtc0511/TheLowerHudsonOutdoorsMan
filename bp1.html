          While I'm slightly older and smarter now, in Highschool id often fish
          the Wallkill River in Middletown NY by wearing a swimsuit and water
          shoes and wadding down river from the public access point to the
          Bridge. Id fish the way down and the way back up as well. This was
          successful for catching 8 – 12 inch smallmouths. Almost every single
          time I'd go in the Moring, I would catch 5-15 fish in 2-3 hours. I
          never caught any real gigantic fish in this spot, the largest was
          around 16 inches long, weighing 2-3 lbs. 14–16-inch fish were common,
          but it was not a guarantee to catch them.
        </p>

        <p>
          This most common fish for me to catch out of the Wallkill is
          definitely small mouth bass, I’ve caught a few panfish as well, but
          small mouth bass are the predominant catch. I’ve head there’s walleye
          in the wall kill however I have not personally caught or heard of any
          caught. Odds are the walleye population is more abundant in other
          places along the river. I’ve seen a few of my buddies pull decent carp
          out as-well. In the end the wallkill river can make a fun and
          productive smallmouth fishing spot, you can catch plenty of 8-14 inch
          smallies
        </p>

        <p>
          The tactics that I used to catch so many fish were to cast into breaks
          in the current and especially wherever the water was ripping around a
          large rock or a fallen tree. The tackle i would take with me consisted
          of a single strap pack, a Daiwa samurai 6-foot rod/reel combo with 6-8
          Lb line and a Daiwa bait caster with 50lb braid. Depending on the day
          I would leave the bait caster in the car because honestly the smaller
          spinning rod was more ideal for the low hanging trees, and the
          lightweight tackle made catching the smaller fish more fun. On the
          spinning rod I would cast with inline spinner baits, Zoom Fat Alberts
          with split shots or a swim jig head, or Keitech Swing Impacts. The
          bait caster typically had topwater, a jig, or a crankbait.

      <h3>How To Have The Most Success</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="artpic">
      <div class="articles">
        <p>
          The most efficient way I found to fish this strip of river was to use
          my spinning rod with an inline spinner and toss it upriver pulling it
          near current brakes and reeling in quickly. The little smallmouths
          that littered this strip would strike aggressively on fast moving
          lures early in the morning, while its still slightly dark out. If I
          caught one on a break that I could target by standing on a rock or on
          the shoreline I would stop and fish that same spot, often enough
          within a few minutes i would catch another, there was times I would
          catch 4-7 fish in the exact same spot in a 20–30-minute period.
          Usually, the more fish that I would catch in the same spot the smaller
          the size of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the bite was slow and I would struggle to catch fish a tactic
          that never let me down was to throw a rooster tail or a very small
          crank bait. The fish were usually 8 inches so nothing large but I
          can’t remember a single time this let me down. On the other hand, I
          never had any luck throwing bottom jigs, I lost a few before I stopped
          throwing them, but they never caught me any fish, I attribute this to
          the rocky bottom that made getting snagged more likely then getting a
          bite.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s another Spot to fish from shore downriver of the bridge over
          the highway, I am not sure if this is a public access point or private
          land, I’ve never seen any posted signs or anything. This spot is
          located at the end of mt joy road, there’s a turn around on the left
          and a road blocked by a gate on the right. In front of the gate
          there’s a little pull off. You park there and walk about 100 yards to
          the river. This spot is a decent spot to catch fish from shore. At
          this spot swim jigs and senkos have been very productive,
          unfortunately this spot doesn’t produce as many fish as wadding the
          river, however the fish I pull here tend to be much larger then
          slightly up river, however they are not as abundant.

      <h3>A Final Note</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="artpic">
      <p>
        While I had a lot of success with my tactics i have not been to the
        Wallkill to fish while wadding in 5-6 years, It was brought to my
        attention that i was fishing down river of a water treatment plant that
        disinfected and returned sewage water to the Wallkill, as well as the
        Wallkill having issues with containing the pesticide DDT according to
        online sources. While I did not suffer any serious issues yet from
        wadding in the Wallkill, there's probably better alternatives, such as a
        raft and floating the river, or wearing waders and sticking to the
        shallow water and shorelines. I am not sure as to who owns the
        shorelines, however i didn't see any posted signs and believe a large
        chunk is government owned. Or you can fish the access point down river
        that i covered, its not quite as fun but still produces quality fish.
