        While I'm slightly older and smarter now, in Highschool id often fish
        the Wallkill River in Middletown NY by wearing a swimsuit and water
        shoes and wadding down river from the public access point to the Bridge.
        Id fish the way down and the way back up as well. This was successful
        for catching 8 – 12 inch smallmouths. Almost every single time I'd go in
        the Moring, I would catch 5-15 fish in 2-3 hours. I never caught any
        real gigantic fish in this spot, the largest was around 16 inches long,
        weighing 2-3 lbs. 14–16-inch fish were common, but it was not a
        guarantee to catch them ...<a class="readmore" href="../blogposts/bp1.html"> Read more  </a>

        A fairly well known spot located in Warwick NY, Cascade Lake is a
        great fishing opportunity. While I usually prefer to fish small rivers
        and larger streams due to my lack of a boat, Cascade Lake is excellent
        because it is a town owned park, and you are able to hike the entire
        shoreline. ...Upon arrival you may notice the lake seems rather small, but do not
        let it deceive you, almost every fish I've caught here has been
        decent, very few dinks. ...<a class="readmore" href="../blogposts/bp2.html"> Read more  </a>
