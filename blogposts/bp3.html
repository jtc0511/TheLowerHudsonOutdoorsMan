        If you're interested in fishing but don't have many friends who are into
        fishing it can be semi daunting trying to figure out what gear you
        should get in order to get started. There's an array of choices with
        terms that can be confusing. We are here to help cut through some of the
        noise and get you started. ...<a

      A fairly well known spot located in Warwick NY, Cascade Lake is a great
      fishing opportunity. While I usually prefer to fish small rivers and
      larger streams due to my lack of a boat, Cascade Lake is excellent because
      it is a town owned park, and you are able to hike the entire shoreline.
      ...Upon arrival you may notice the lake seems rather small, but do not let
      it deceive you, almost every fish I've caught here has been decent, very
      few dinks. ...<a class="readmore" href="../blogposts/bp2.html">
