      Hi, thank you for checking out our website. I’m JT, my little brother
      Coilin is my fishing buddy. We are from Orange County NY, I often have
      researched fishing spots in the local area online and the results I tend
      to find are decent at best. The goals of Our website are to help people in
      the area learn tips for fishing spots and tell you some of the public
      spots we fish.

    <h1>Fishing the Wallkill River in Orange County</h1>
    <p>
      While I'm slightly older and smarter now, in Highschool id often fish the
      Wallkill River in Middletown NY by wearing a swimsuit and water shoes and
      wadding down river from the public access point to the Bridge. Id fish the
      way down and the way back up as well. This was successful for catching 8 –
      12 inch smallmouths. Almost every single time I'd go in the Moring, I
      would catch 5-15 fish in 2-3 hours. I never caught any real gigantic fish
      in this spot, the largest was around 16 inches long, weighing 2-3 lbs.
      14–16-inch fish were common, but it was not a guarantee to catch them.

    <h4>Who We Are</h4>
    <p>
      I‘m JT, I have been fishing for about 20 years now. I first started
      fishing when i was 4 or 5 years old, it all started one morning when i was
      flipping through channels on the TV looking for Disney but landed on the
      outdoors channel and watched a bass tournament until my dad came out and
      found me, i asked “can we do that!”
