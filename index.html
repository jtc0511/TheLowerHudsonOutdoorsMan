      <h1 class="titles">Fishing the Wallkill River in Orange County</h1>
      <p>
        While I'm slightly older and smarter now, in Highschool id often fish
        the Wallkill River in Middletown NY by wearing a swimsuit and water
        shoes and wadding down river from the public access point to the Bridge.
        Id fish the way down and the way back up as well. This was successful
        for catching 8 – 12 inch smallmouths. Almost every single time I'd go in
        the Moring, I would catch 5-15 fish in 2-3 hours. I never caught any
        real gigantic fish in this spot, the largest was around 16 inches long,
        weighing 2-3 lbs. 14–16-inch fish were common, but it was not a
        guarantee to catch them.

  <h4>Who We Are</h4>
  <p>
    I‘m JT, I have been fishing for about 20 years now. I first started fishing
    when i was 4 or 5 years old, it all started one morning when i was flipping
    through channels on the TV looking for Disney but landed on the outdoors
    channel and watched a bass tournament until my dad came out and found me, i
    asked “can we do that!”
