    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      I‘m JT, I have been fishing for about 20 years now. I first started
      fishing when i was 4 or 5 years old, it all started one morning when i was
      flipping through channels on the TV looking for Disney but landed on the
      outdoors channel and watched a bass tournament until my dad came out and
      found me, i asked “can we do that!”
    </p>

    <p>
      When we first started out we had no clue what we were doing, but it was
      always a great time with my dad, and later with my brother Aswell. Growing
      up we caught a number of different fish from bass trout and walleye to
      catfish sunfish and perch. After some years fishing, we got a canoe, that
      opened many doors previously closed as we no longer needed to find a good
      spot on the shore, all we needed was a public boat launch. Nowadays I
      mostly fish with my youngest Brother Colin who is in middle school. We
      fish from Shore and mostly Target Bass and Pickrel. Sometimes we fish at
      our grandfathers house on the Delaware, that is always a good time.

    <h4>Why I'm Making This Site</h4>
    <p>
      I am creating this website because through many google searches for
      fishing in the local area the results were underwhelming to say the least.
      I want to create a resource for Local fisherman to gain tips and tricks,
      as well as possibly learn of some new public fishing spots. I am also
      using this website to practice my website development skills and improve
      them. I will be making Colin write some Articles for you guys to read as
      well so he can practice his writing skills. If anyone else would like to
      contribute content reach out to me!
