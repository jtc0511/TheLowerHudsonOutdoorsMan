    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      I‘m JT, I have been fishing for about 20 years now. I first started
      fishing when i was 4 or 5 years old, it all started one morning when i was
      flipping through channels on the TV looking for Disney but landed on the
      outdoors channel and watched a bass tournament until my dad came out and
      found me, I asked “can we do that!”
    </p>

    <p>
      When we first started out we had no clue what we were doing, but it was
      always a great time with my dad, and later with my brother Aswell. Growing
      up we caught a number of different fish from bass trout and walleye to
      catfish sunfish and perch. After some years fishing, we got a canoe, that
      opened many doors previously closed as we no longer needed to find a good
      spot on the shore, all we needed was a public boat launch. Nowadays I
      mostly fish with my youngest Brother Colin who is in middle school. We
      fish from Shore and mostly Target Bass and Pickrel. Sometimes we fish at
      our grandfathers house on the Delaware, that is always a good time.
    </p>

      Nowadays when I fish with my buddies or Colin its from the shore,
      occasionally we still go out with my dad and get to use the canoe. We have
      mostly fished for smallmouth bass and some largemouth bass. It is my goal
      to save up and get a nice Jon boat around the end of the year, I do not
      want to get anything too large however, because a lot of lakes around me
      do not allow gas motors so I'll need a boat I can push around with an
      Eletric motor. I am unsure if ill go with a john boat with decking or not
      as there are a few lakes i would like to be able to fish but its hand
      launch only. For now, we make the most of the shoreline and we have an
      exciting time doing it.

      One trait that my father instilled into me when fishing is to pick up
      garbage! Especially when fishing non posted private land, the last thing
      we want is to lose a fishing spot to a bunch of litterbugs. He would
      almost always have a plastic bag and would pick up as much as he could
      before we fished and if anything got dropped while we fished he would make
      sure at the end that everything was cleaned up and as nice as or better
      than we found it. I tend to be forgetful about bringing a bag with me to
      clean up other people's mess, I bring a bag with me maybe half the time
      and clean random litter i find. But i always make sure I leave nothing
      behind and do not attribute to any litter.

    <h4>Why I'm Making This Site</h4>
    <p>
      I am creating this website because through many google searches for
      fishing in the local area the results were underwhelming to say the least.
      I want to create a resource for Local fisherman to gain tips and tricks,
      as well as possibly learn of some new public fishing spots. I am also
      using this website to practice my website development skills and improve
      them. I will be making Colin write some Articles for you guys to read as
      well so he can practice his writing skills. If anyone else would like to
      contribute content reach out to me!
