    <h1>Things to Come</h1>
    <p>
      While I do not expect this blog to gain a huge following, I do hope to
      grow a following and be able to do some cool and exciting things with and
      for you all. The goal of this is to help all anglers, but especially
      younger or inexperienced anglers located in or around region 3 in New
      York. I want to provide 1 or 2 posts a month and give insight into the
      fishing spots I go. Alot of anglers keep their cards close to their chest
      when it comes to fishing spots, and there is definitely some spots I'm
      hesitant to share with you all, but I do not want to be a gate keeper and
      I want to help the fishing community grow and flourish. Please just
      remember to respect the fish, don't take fish home from the same spot
      every time, I'm a strong believer in catch and release most of the time,
      however, occasionally ill bring a few home to cook them up.
    </p>

      I also can't wait to have enough of a following to do some giveaways/
      raffles with you all. The first giveaway is going to be doing is a new St.
      Croix Bass X casting rod. All you need to do to enter the giveaway is sign
      up for our newsletter to get updates when we release new posts. We will
      have more giveaways as we gain more popularity, I also plan to do a few
      limited entry raffles for rods and reels when the time is right. I really
      really want to host a fishing tournament but Iâ€™m unsure how soon I'll be
      able to set something up because I imagine there is some rules and
      regulations regarding that.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we wait for the giveaways and raffles, we will be releasing content
      of some locations I've fished in my 20ish years fishing orange county NY
      and the surrounding areas, well give advice to new and seasoned anglers
      alike such as rod and reel recommendations, tackle recommendations, and
      approaches to fishing. As the weather gets warmer and we can get outside
      more i will release more current content on fishing.
